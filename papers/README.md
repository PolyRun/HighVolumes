## Algorithm

The specific algorithm we would like implement to is "Algorithm 1" given in this paper:

[A Fast and Practical Method to Estimate Volumes of Convex Polytopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0120)
(Cunjing Ge, Feifei Ma, Jian Zhang 2013)


## Survey
[How to compute the volume in high dimension?](https://www.math.tamu.edu/~rojas/simonvitzvolumehigh.pdf)
(Miklos Simonovits 2003)
