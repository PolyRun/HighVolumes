# Notes for plots

Mostly generated by instructions in benchmark/bm.py

TODO: 3,5,7

## 1
plots look good

output file missing, needed for table.
 -> OK

## 2
Very nice plots.

Shows: 8-set, different effect for cube and cross, div bound, 5-flop bound

 -> Performance for cubeRot

## 3
A bit too jittery, should up step_size.

But shows 8-set well. And overheads of sparse bodies. Especially JIT and L1i.

 -> upped step_size to 500
 -> situation a bit better, but still has random kinks...
 -> rerun, configs were wrong, step_size=100,r=10.

## 4
ok, also a bit jittery, right?

do they show what they should, Silvan?
 -> inspect compiled code. see if can get more info/desc.

## 5
Measurement mostly stable.

JIT performes worse than on old plot, why? Did we choose the right version?

 -> r=100 maybe was just too low? Upped it to 10000. Was even higher for prev plot.
 -> quite a bit better now. maybe run even a bit longer?
 -> try bigger body, see if run into iCache issues for JIT? try n=200 - TODO
 -> but new-plot for n=100 is ok already.
 -> OK, need to see what to show now.
 -> Correct this: r was somehow again too low... - try again

## 6
looks very good

## 7
Look ok.

coordWalk_1 makes JIT stronger, should check other bm to see if used there.
Which plot should we use? Runtime?

-> Fixed the configurations. Must rerun!


## 8
Basically as good as old plots used to be. We wanted this, right?
-> maybe not needed if 7 looks better now?

## 9
Data looks promising, need to make table now.

Maybe we can run our code higher, but would require larger range than double for determinant/volume ratio calculation.
 -> works up to B_19, beyond get stuck somewhere in shallow-beta cut...
