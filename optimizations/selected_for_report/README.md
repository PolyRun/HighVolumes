# Notes for plots

Mostly generated by instructions in benchmark/bm.py

## 1
plots look good

output file missing, needed for table.

## 2
Very nice plots.

Shows: 8-set, different effect for cube and cross, div bound, 5-flop bound

## 3
A bit too jittery, should up step_size.

But shows 8-set well. And overheads of sparse bodies. Especially JIT and L1i.

## 4
ok, also a bit jittery, right?

do they show what they should, Silvan?

## 5
Measurement mostly stable.

JIT performes worse than on old plot, why? Did we choose the right version?

## 6
looks very good

## 7
Look ok.

coordWalk_1 makes JIT stronger, should check other bm to see if used there.
Which plot should we use? Runtime?

## 8
Basically as good as old plots used to be. We wanted this, right?

## 9
Data looks promising, need to make table now.

Maybe we can run our code higher, but would require larger range than double for determinant/volume ratio calculation.
